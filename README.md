## About the app
This project developed by a team, and it introduces **InstancePharm**, a mobile pharmacy application designed to simplify and improve access to essential healthcare services. It addresses common challenges in locating, ordering, and managing medications by offering an easy-to-use digital solution.

The app allows users to:
- Quickly search for medications
- Place online orders
- Locate nearby pharmacies

To further enhance the user experience, InstancePharm includes features such as:
